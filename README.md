I made this app for a school project, with Material Design principles in mind.

Features photo search, endless scrolling, sorting, bookmarks and search history.

Utilizes the [500px API](https://github.com/500px/api-documentation) without using Retrofit (those were the rules for the final project).

It's not entirely finished, hence not published on Google Play.

I have no current plans to develop this app.

Feel free to fork the project or submit pull requests!
