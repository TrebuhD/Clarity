Simple & fast material design image browser for 500px.

100% open source, feel free to submit pull requests or fork this project.

## The how:
- The [500px API](https://github.com/500px/api-documentation) consumed with Retrofit
- Picasso for image loading
- Endless scrolling RecycleView-powered grid layout.
- ConstraintLayout for the detail view.
- The photos get cached into InternalStorage asynchronously.

## The what else:
- I had some problems with getting shared element transitions to work properly. This feature is work-in-progress.
- Feel free to suggest new features and bugfixes on our [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/N9JdPKtD/clarity):
