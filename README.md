# Clarity
Material design image browser for 500px.

[![MIT licensed](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)](#) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/TrebuhD/Clarity.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/TrebuhD/Clarity)

Final project for my Android programming course.

Created with Material Design principles in mind.

Features search, endless scrolling, sorting, bookmarks and search history.

Utilizes the [500px API](https://github.com/500px/api-documentation) without using Retrofit (those were the rules for the final project).

Uses RecyclerView and Fragments wherever possible.

It's not entirely finished, hence not published on Google Play.

I have no current plans to develop this app further. I think the official 500px client is pretty good already.

Feel free to fork the project or submit pull requests!
